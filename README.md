## Example program

The standard example program uses a list as data store. It can not be adaptet like the following [program](#example-program-with-abstraction) with abstraction. It can be found in the `LibraryManagement` solution under [FormsNoAbstraction](./FormsNoAbstraction).

---

## Example program with abstraction

The example program with abstraction includes a modular `DataService` which is implemented by different libraries e.g.:

1. `ListDataService`
1. `SQLiteDataService`
1. `DbDataService`

The `DataService` library implements the Validation of the `Book` objects. It can be found in the `LibraryManagement` solution under [Forms](./Forms).

### `ListDataService`

Implements a simple list in backend and is designed for testing purpose.

### `SQLiteDataService`

Data is saved in a SQLite database

### `DbDataService`

Can be used within every database that inherits from `DbConnection` and `DbCommand` (e.g. `mSQL`, `MySQL`, `mariaDB`, `...`).
